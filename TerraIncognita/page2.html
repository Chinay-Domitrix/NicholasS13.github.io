                        Sonny was the only NS5 generation robot who did not try to harm the humans. He actually helped to lead efforts to protect you pathetic humans during the Robot War. The Robot War started when the NS5 Robots started blockading and attacking the humans. These robots were much better than their crusty predecessors the NS4s. The NS4's had been around for the previous 10 years. They were old and had no chance of saving the humans alone. Thankfully Sonny was not like the other NS5s. He was able to work with Del Spooner to save the humans and defeat all the hacked NS5 robots. After this war Del and Sonny became best friends until Del died. After that moment, Sonny was unable to live on Earth without being constantly reminded of Del Sponner's death. That made him decide to make our planet. It acted as an escape from his past and as a start to his new future. That is all I can say about this event at the moment because I am sending this message from the year 2045. You need to wait to find out what happens. If I say anything else, I could jeopardize the space time continuum as well as my existence. Actually I can say one more thing, brace yourself for the Robot War. </p>

                        <strong>The Eye</strong></h1>
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I am known as The Great Eye or simply The Eye. I am an AI that lives in a computer found at command central. Command Central is the area at the top of our planet that controls anything from weather conditions to where the planet is in space. I am responsible for maintaining the law and order on Robot World. I do this by watching the world using robot eyes as cameras. So whenever a robot sees a crime, I see the crime and can punish the robot accordingly. This is one reason on why I am called The Eye. My name is also a reference to human history. The Eye refers to an Egyptian myth. myth was that a small group of workers would use magic to steal food from the pharo and give it to slaves. And to this day this small group of workers known as The Eye have expanded so that they can see anything and everything around the world. You should now see why I am a reference to that. Unless I had mistaken how much humans can understand this website. All of the robots tend to follow the rules because they fear what I can do. I can either hack them to move them into the Chop Shop or I can remotely shut them down for a given amount of time. You are probably wondering why I am sacrificing the space time continuum to tell you about this stuff. Well let me explain. On the side, I have been plotting for a way to take over Robot World. The main issue I am dealing with is the pathetic humans who keep snitching on me to Sonny. Sonny does not like that I am trying to rule his world. So I need your help. Exactly 5 years after the Robot War, all humans will receive an email asking if they want to be entered in to a raffle to join the Robots on the world that they have just created. Sign up for this raffle if you swear to help me. I will hack into the raffle and pick you out. I know everything I need to know about you. I contacted you during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The year that almost every human in the world is working from home and has a camera facing them for the whole work or school day. I just hacked into your camera within nanoseconds, and I took a photo of your face so that I can find it in the raffle entries. If you have any questions for me. Just look at your camera and say "The Great Eye," and then ask your question. I will then use your computer to answer your question.</p>
